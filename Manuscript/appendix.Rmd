## Changes to PHYLACINE database
We modified the body mass of two extinct species in the PHYLACINE database before modelling and analyses: body mass of the extinct species _Sinomegaceros ordosianus_ was set equal to the mass of _Sinomegaceros yabei_ and body mass of the extinct _Dusicyon australis_ to _Dusicyon avus_.

## Maxent species distribution models (SDMs)
Climatic suitability of terrestrial mammals was modelled using maximum entropy (Maxent) models using the *maxnet* R-package based on inhomogeneous Poisson processes [@phillips2017opening]. Maxent is a presence-background approach, in which environments occupied by a species are contrasted with the available environmental space [@elith2011statistical; @merow2013practical]. We ran Maxent with the default settings of Maxent, besides disabling threshold features to avoid locally overfitted response curves [@merow2013practical; @merow2014we]. We used 100,000 randomly sampled background records – cf. 10,000 that is commonly used – to ensure greater representation of environmental variables available within background areas [@guevara2018toward]. Background buffers were obtained for each species combining current and present-natural ranges and calculating the maximum distance between edge and centroid of the largest continuous range, ensuring buffer sizes reflected capabilities of the individuals species [@poo2014galictis; @hof2018bioenergy]. An example is shown in figure S\#. We only modelled species that had at least 10 presence locations, thus excluding 76 rare species with restricted geographic distribution. In total, we modeled 4,130 of the 4,206 living terrestrial mammals.

![Example of how buffer sizes were calculated for the white rhyno (_Ceratotherium simum_). The buffer size was calculated as the maximum distance *d* (black line) between centroid and edge (black points) of the largest continuous range of the species (green). We estimated _d_ following the same procedure for each species, resulting in species-specific buffer sizes that reflected the different dispersal capabilities of species.](/home/GIT/Trophic_restoration/Manuscript/Figures/varbuffer.png){ width=50% }

We assessed the predictive performance of Maxent models through five-fold cross validation: we calculated the average continuous Boyce index (CBI; @hirzel2006evaluating), which indicates how much models discriminate against random expectation, and the average Area Under the Receiver Operating Curve (AUC; @swets1988measuring), which indicates how well models differentiate between presences and pseudo-absences regardless of the degree of difference between them. Model fit was inspected by the average omission rate based on the minimum training presence value (ORMTP). CBI values range between -1 and 1, where values > 0 indicate the model's output is positively correlated with the true probability of presence and values < 0 indicate it is negatively correlated with the true probability of presence; AUC values range from <= 0.5 for models with discrimination no better than random to 1 for models with perfect discrimination between occupied and unoccupied places [@fielding1997review]; and ORMTP values range from 0 for models that are not overfit to 1 for models that are overfit. To convert continuous suitability predictions to binary layers indicating suitable/unsuitable habitat, we used as threshold the suitability value that maximised sensitivity and specificity (MSS) as suggested by @liu2016selection. We further assessed the performance of Maxent models by comparing projections of climatic suitability with 136 introduced range maps from @lundgren2018introduced (n = 22 species) and IUCN (@iucn2016iucn; n = 114 species). Introduced range maps were selected from @lundgren2018introduced over the IUCN [@iucn2016iucn] for three species found in both datasets (_Cervus elaphus_, _Ovibos moschatus_, and _Rangifer tarandus_).

Evaluation statistics indicated in general very high to excellent quality of Maxent models. CBI index and AUC were on average very high (Table S\#) and ORMTP was in low, indicating that models were in general not overfitted. Importantly, species chosen as rewilding replacement in downstream analyses had in general very high to excellent predictive performance: high CBI and AUC, and low ORMTP (Table S\#). Also, much of the species' known introduction ranges were captured by Maxent models (Fig. S\#): the median of the predicted introduction range was 0.84, with a median absolute deviation equal to 0.23.

![Evaluation statistics of Maxent species distribution models (SDMs). Continuous Boyce index (A) and the area under the receiving operating curve (AUC, B) were in general very good to excellent, showing SDMs had high performance on discriminating climatic suitable habitats from unsuitable ones. Omission rate of minimum training points (ORMTP, C) was generally low, indicating that models were not overfitting. SDMs predicted most of the ranges of introduced species not used for model calibration (D). Introduction area was obtained from the IUCN current introduction ranges [@iucn2016iucn] and the ranges described in @lundgren2018introduced, both of which were not included in the PHYLACINE present-natural and current ranges [@faurby2018phylacine].](Figures/SDM_stats.png)

<!-- ## Statistical analyses
To investigate if trophic rewilding has the potential to restore food web interactions in the 209 protected areas examined to pre-human conditions, we used generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs). We selected the error distribution for the GLMMs based on the response data type and to remedy overdispersion [@zuur2009mixed]. We used a Poisson distribution to model the number of species at each trophic level with the fixed effects scenario, trophic level, and their interaction. A negative binomial distribution was used to model the predator-prey interactions across trophic levels with the fixed effects scenario, the trophic levels involved in the trophic link, and their interaction. For both GLMMs, we used the random effects 'protected area' and 'Ecozone' to account for non-comparable pseudo-replicates and different ecological histories of mammal assemblages in Ecozones [@olson2001terrestrial]. We assessed the significance among scenarios by performing multiple pair-wise contrasts with Bonferroni correction and estimated the magnitude of the differences using Cohen's *d* effect size [@cohen1988statistical; @sawilowsky2009new]: $d = \frac{\bar{x}_i - \bar{x}_j}{s_{ij}}$, where $\bar{x}_i$ is the sample mean of scenario *i*, $\bar{x}_j$ the sample mean of scenario *j*, and $s_{ij}$ the pooled standard deviation of samples *i* and *j*.

Finally, we repeated all analyses for 206 areas evenly distributed across Ecozones. By studying the restoration potential of trophic rewilding in protected areas, we could investigate how much trophic rewilding can restore top-down control in areas that are likely suitable for rewilding already. However, by focusing on protected areas, which are unevenly distributed on continents, we might have underestimated the potential of trophic rewilding in areas that did not have large protected areas with strict IUCN management category but that could be suitable for rewilding in the near future, e.g. rural areas in Europe where wildlife is coming back after land abandonment [@chapron2014recovery; @deinet2017wildlife]. We generated 36 random areas $\simeq$ 5,000 km^2 randomly in each Ecozone, derived their mammal assemblages for each scenario, inferred their predator-prey food webs under present-natural, current, and rewilding scenario, and performed the same statistical analyses used for the protected areas.

All data processing and analyses were performed in the R programming language version 3.6.1 [@R] using packages tidyverse [@wickham2017tidyverse], maxnet [@maxnet], dismo [@dismo], sf [@sf], raster [@raster], doParallel [@doParallel], foreach [@foreach], performance [@performance], emmeans [@emmeans], and estimate [@estimate]. All spatial analyses were conducted using the Behrmann cylindrical equal-area projection. Ecozones were derived using the World Wildlife Foundation shapefile ([WWF](https://www.worldwildlife.org/publications/terrestrial-ecoregions-of-the-world), @olson2002global). Figures were made using packages ggplot2 [@ggplot2] with maps displayed in the Molleweide projection.

## Statistical model
### Trophic levels
THe number of species per trophic level in each scenario was modeled as count data using a Poisson distribution for errors. Because the analyses were conducted on food webs that are not replicates, but pseudo-replications, we performed generalized linear mixed model regressions using scenario and trophic level as fixed effects and food webs as random factor. Moreover, Ecozones are defined based on diverging ecological and evolutionary histories and hence they were included as an additional random factor in the model to account for differences in Ecozones that are not directly comparable -- i.e. Ecozones were considered pseudo-replication rather than replicates. The complete statistical model took the mathematical form:
\begin{equation}
	N_{i, \, j} = \nu + \Sigma + (\nu \, \Sigma) + E_i + W_j + \epsilon_{i, \, j}
\end{equation}
where $N_{i, \, j}$ is the number of species, $\nu$ the effect of each trophic level, $\Sigma$ the effect of each scenario, $(\nu \, \Sigma)$ the interaction term between trophic level and scenario, $E_i$ the effect of the Ecozone, $W_j$ the effect of the food web, and $\epsilon_{i, \, j}$ the residual deviations. Specifying Ecozones and food webs as random effects means that $E_i$ and $W_j$ are drawn from normally distributed samples: $E_i \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu_e, \sigma_e)$ and $W_j \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu_w, \sigma_w)$.

Number of predator-prey interactions among trophic levels was also modeled as a discrete count distribution using a negative binomial distribution for the errors, as data was significantly overdispersed. We performed generalized linear mixed model regressions with scenario and the trophic link -- categorical variable indicating the trophic levels of prey and predators -- as fixed effect. Similarly to the number of species per trophic level, we included also food webs and Ecozones as random effect. The complete statistical model took the mathematical form:
\begin{equation}
	L_{i, \, j} = \lambda + \Sigma + (\lambda \, \Sigma) + E_i + W_j + \epsilon_{i, \, j}
\end{equation}
where $L_{i, \, j}$ is the number links between two trophic levels, $\lambda$ the effect of each trophic link, $\Sigma$ the effect of each scenario, $(\lambda \, \Sigma)$ the interaction term between trophic levels link and scenario, $E_i$ the effect of the Ecozone, $W_j$ the effect of the food web, and $\epsilon_{i, \, j}$ the residual deviations. Specifying Ecozones and food webs as random effects means that $E_i$ and $W_j$ are drawn from normally distributed samples: $E_i \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu_e, \sigma_e)$ and $W_j \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu_w, \sigma_w)$.

Statistical analyses of trophic levels were performed using *R* package *lme4* [@lme4]. The working code for the number of species per trophic level was:
```r
model <- glmer(
  Proportion ~ -1 + Scenario * Trophic_level + (1 | Ecozone) + (1 | Web),
  data = dat,
  family = 'poisson',
)
```
For the number of links among trophic levels the working code was:
```r
model <- glmer.nb(
  Proportion ~ -1 + Scenario * Edge + (1 | Ecozone) + (1 | Web),
  data = dat,
  control = glmerControl(optimizer = "bobyqa", optCtrl=list(maxfun=10e6))
)
```
We used *R* package *emmeans* [@emmeans] and *estimate* [@estimate] to perform pairwise contrasts adjusting with the Bonferroni correction and we directly obtained the difference across scenarios of the number of species in trophic level or trophic interaction among trophic levels, the p-value of the contrast, and the effect size of the change as Cohen's *d* [@cohen1988statistical]. -->
